Semantic Relatedness
====================

Facilitates relatedness measurements for collective disambiguation.

Semantic Relatedness depends on a knowledge base to perform relatedness measurements between entities. At this stage of developments, the module includes a bulk loading script that facilitates loading RDF triples from DBpedia to a local Graph DB. Other knowledge bases may be supported in the future.
